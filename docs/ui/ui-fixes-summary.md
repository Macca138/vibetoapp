# üé® Critical UI Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ **Issues Found & Fixed**

### 1. **CRITICAL: Invalid Tailwind Color** 
**File:** `src/components/workflow/StepNavigation.tsx`
**Problem:** Used `bg-gray-25` (doesn't exist) making locked workflow steps invisible
**Fix:** Changed to `bg-gray-100 border-gray-200` for proper visibility
**Impact:** Workflow navigation now shows locked steps clearly

### 2. **Form Field Border Visibility**
**Files:** 
- `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`  
- `src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx`
- `src/components/workflow/WorkflowField.tsx`
**Problem:** `border-gray-300` too light, hard to see form boundaries
**Fix:** Changed to `border-gray-400` + added `shadow-sm` for better definition
**Impact:** Form fields now have clear, visible borders

### 3. **Text Contrast Improvement**
**File:** `src/components/workflow/WorkflowStep.tsx`
**Problem:** `text-gray-700` on `bg-indigo-50` had insufficient contrast  
**Fix:** Changed to `text-gray-800` + added `border-indigo-100` for definition
**Impact:** Step prompts are now easier to read

### 4. **Loading Spinner Enhancement**
**File:** `src/components/projects/ProjectList.tsx`
**Problem:** Loading spinner only had bottom border, looked incomplete
**Fix:** Added `border-t-transparent` for proper spinner appearance
**Impact:** Loading states now look professional
