## 🔄 Data Handoff Protocol

### Core Principles
1. **Progressive Refinement**: Each step builds upon validated outputs from previous steps
2. **Component-Based Handoff**: Use defined components for consistent data transfer
3. **User Validation**: Require user confirmation before data flows to next step
4. **Complete Context**: Later steps receive all previous context for comprehensive processing

### Handoff Flow
```
Step 1 → Step 2: projectOutline
Step 2 → Step 3: appDetails + featuresList + techChoices
Step 3 → Step 4: appDetails + featuresList + technicalArchitecture
Step 4 → Step 5: appOverview + detailedUserStories + uxFlows
Step 5 → Step 6: appOverview + designSystem + platformAdaptations
Step 6 → Step 7: Complete 1-6 context + screenSpecifications
Step 7 → Step 8: Complete 1-7 context + technicalSpecification
Step 8 → Step 9: Complete 1-8 context + developmentRules
```

### Data Validation
- **User Confirmation**: "Are you happy with this analysis/output?"
- **Component Validation**: Ensure all required components are present
- **Data Consistency**: Check consistency across steps
- **Completeness Check**: Verify all required fields are populated

## 🛠️ Implementation Requirements

### Chat Interface Design
- **Single chat component** per step
- **Natural conversation flow** with AI agent
- **Progressive disclosure** of complex outputs
- **Validation checkpoints** for user confirmation

### Backend Agent System
- **Specialized system prompts** for each agent
- **Context injection** with previous steps data
- **Component extraction** from AI responses
- **Data transformation** for handoff compatibility

### Data Persistence
- **Structured storage** of component definitions
- **Version control** for step revisions
- **Audit trail** of user validations
- **Backup mechanisms** for data recovery

This specification ensures zero data loss and sophisticated agent handoffs while maintaining simple chat UX for users.
