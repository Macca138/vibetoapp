## Implementation Plan Overview

**Estimated Timeline:** 800-1200 development hours (approx. 100-150 person-days assuming an 8-hour workday, for a single developer with AI coding assistants). This is a high-level estimate, and detailed task complexity below will help refine it.

**Development Approach:** Single developer leveraging AI coding assistants for code generation, debugging, and best practice adherence. Focus on iterative development, with each step resulting in a buildable and testable state of the application. Prioritize core functionalities and infrastructure setup before diving into complex features.

**Task Complexity Legend:**
* ðŸŸ¢ Small (1-2 hours)
* ðŸŸ¡ Medium (4-8 hours)
* ðŸ”´ Large (1-2 days)

    * `app/api/stripe/checkout-session/route.ts`: (New file) API endpoint to create Stripe Checkout session.
    * `.env`: Add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRODUCT_ID_PROJECT`, `STRIPE_PRODUCT_ID_SUBSCRIPTION`.
* **Step Dependencies:** Step 3, Step 6.
* **User Instructions:**
    * Set up a Stripe account and obtain API keys.
    * Define `UserSubscription` model and migrate DB.
    * Implement the backend API endpoint for creating Stripe Checkout sessions.
    * Configure Stripe products for project-based and subscription models.

    * **Call-to-Action:** Prominent buttons to initiate payment.
    * **Loading State:** Indicate when redirecting to Stripe.
    * **Success/Error Pages:** Redirect users to clear success/failure pages after checkout.
* **Validation:** Implement a temporary "Buy Now" button on the dashboard. Click it and verify redirection to Stripe Checkout. Complete a test payment.
* **Token Usage Estimate:** High
* **Processing Time:** Large
* **Cost Category:** Feature Development (Payment)

**Step 22: Implement Stripe Webhook Handling for Payments/Subscriptions** ðŸ”´
* **Task:** Create a Stripe webhook endpoint to handle asynchronous events (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `customer.subscription.updated`). Update user and subscription statuses in the database based on these events.
* **Files:**
    * `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`: (New file) Stripe webhook endpoint.
    * `lib/stripe.ts`: (New file) Stripe client initialization and webhook verification utility.
* **Step Dependencies:** Step 21.
* **User Instructions:**
    * Configure a webhook endpoint in your Stripe dashboard.
    * Implement webhook handler logic to process events.
    * Use Stripe CLI to test webhooks locally.
* **UX/UI Considerations:** None. Backend system.
* **Validation:** Trigger test webhook events (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`) and verify that user's subscription status or project access is updated correctly in the database.
* **Token Usage Estimate:** High
* **Processing Time:** Large
* **Cost Category:** Feature Development (Payment)

**Step 23: Implement Export Functionality - Backend Processing (PDF/Markdown)** ðŸ”´
* **Task:** Create a backend service that generates export documents (PDF and Markdown initially) from the project's workflow data. Integrate this with Bull Queue for asynchronous processing to prevent timeouts.
* **Files:**
    * `prisma/schema.prisma`: Add `ExportJob` model (id, projectId, userId, format, status, filePath, createdAt, updatedAt).
    * `lib/exportGenerator.ts`: (New file) Logic for generating documents (e.g., using `puppeteer` for PDF, markdown library for MD).
    * `workers/exportWorker.ts`: (New file) Worker to process export jobs from Bull Queue.
    * `app/api/exports/initiate/route.ts`: (New file) API to initiate an export job.
* **Step Dependencies:** Step 3, Step 11, Step 14.
* **User Instructions:**
    * Define `ExportJob` model and migrate DB.
    * Implement document generation logic.
    * Set up a new Bull Queue for export jobs and a corresponding worker.
    * Create an API endpoint to queue export jobs.
* **UX/UI Considerations:**
    * **Export Options:** Clear selection for different formats (PDF, Markdown, Word, JSON - though only PDF/MD implemented here).
    * **Processing State:** "Exporting..." message or a progress indicator for the user.
    * **Notification:** Confirmation message when the export is complete and ready for download/email.
* **Validation:** Initiate a test export from a project. Verify an `ExportJob` is created in the database, the worker processes it, and the output file is generated.
* **Token Usage Estimate:** High
* **Processing Time:** Large
* **Cost Category:** Feature Development

**Step 24: Implement Export Functionality - Email Delivery with Resend** ðŸŸ¡
* **Task:** Extend the export process to send the generated export document (or a download link) to the user's email address via Resend once the export job is complete.
* **Files:**
    * `lib/emailService.ts`: (New file) Utility for sending emails via Resend.
    * `workers/exportWorker.ts`: Update to include email sending logic upon job completion.
* **Step Dependencies:** Step 9 (Resend setup), Step 23.
* **User Instructions:**
    * Configure Resend email sending utility.
    * Update the export worker to trigger email sending.
* **UX/UI Considerations:**
    * **Email Confirmation:** Inform the user that the export will be emailed to them.
    * **Email Content:** A well-formatted email with a direct download link or attachment.
* **Validation:** Initiate an export. Verify the document is generated and an email containing the export is received by the user.
* **Token Usage Estimate:** Low
* **Processing Time:** Short
* **Cost Category:** Feature Development

### Finalization and Deployment

**Step 25: Implement CI/CD Pipeline (Vercel Integration)** ðŸŸ¡
* **Task:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline, ideally with Vercel for Next.js. Configure automated builds, tests, and deployments upon Git pushes to specific branches.
* **Files:**
    * `.github/workflows/main.yml` (or similar for other CI platforms): (New file) Workflow definition for build and deploy.
    * `vercel.json` (optional): Vercel specific configuration.
* **Step Dependencies:** All previous steps (working application).
* **User Instructions:**
    * Connect your Git repository to Vercel.
    * Configure environment variables on Vercel.
    * Set up a CI/CD workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions).
* **UX/UI Considerations:** None. Deployment infrastructure.
* **Validation:** Push a change to the configured branch and verify that the CI/CD pipeline runs, builds the application, and deploys it successfully to a preview or production environment.
* **Token Usage Estimate:** Medium
* **Processing Time:** Medium
* **Cost Category:** Infrastructure

**Step 26: Environment Management and Rollback Strategy** ðŸŸ¢
* **Task:** Document the environment variables required for development, staging, and production environments. Define a simple rollback strategy in case of deployment issues.
* **Files:**
    * `docs/environments.md`: (New file) Documentation for environment variables.
    * `docs/rollback-strategy.md`: (New file) Documentation for rollback procedures.
* **Step Dependencies:** Step 25.
* **User Instructions:**
    * Create documentation for environment variables.
    * Outline the steps for rolling back a bad deployment (e.g., using Vercel's rollback features, or Git revert).
* **UX/UI Considerations:** None. Documentation and operational.
* **Validation:** Verify documentation is clear and comprehensive.
* **Token Usage Estimate:** Low
* **Processing Time:** Short
* **Cost Category:** Documentation
