## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

As this project is in its initial phase, the following steps outline how to begin setting up the development environment as per the implementation plan:

### 1. Create a New Next.js Project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript --eslint .
2. Install Project Dependencies
Bash

npm install
3. Initialize Git Repository
Bash

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
4. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project and populate it with the necessary environment variables. Refer to the .env.example file for a template once generated in later steps. You will need to obtain API keys for services like Google Gemini, Stripe, and Resend, and set up your database URL and NextAuth.js secret.

5. Start Development Server
Bash

npm run dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 once the initial setup is complete.
