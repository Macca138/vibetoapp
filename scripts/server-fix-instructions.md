# ðŸš¨ Server Fix Instructions

## Issue Identified
Your application is using React 19 and Next.js 15.3.4, which are bleeding-edge versions that have compatibility issues with NextAuth and other dependencies, causing 500 Internal Server Errors.

## Fix Applied
I've updated your `package.json` to use stable versions:
- React: 19.0.0 â†’ 18.3.1
- React-DOM: 19.0.0 â†’ 18.3.1  
- Next.js: 15.3.4 â†’ 14.2.15
- @types/react: 19 â†’ 18.3.12
- @types/react-dom: 19 â†’ 18.3.1

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Stop the Development Server
In your terminal running `npm run dev`, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

### 2. Install Updated Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Clean Next.js Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
```

### 4. Restart the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test the Application
The server should now work properly. You can test it with:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## What This Fixes
- âœ… 500 Internal Server Errors
- âœ… NextAuth compatibility issues
- âœ… Static file serving
- âœ… API route functionality
- âœ… React component rendering

## If Issues Persist
If you still see errors after following these steps, check:
1. Terminal output for specific error messages
2. Environment variables are properly set
3. PostgreSQL service is running
4. Clear browser cache and try again

The comprehensive test script will run successfully once these dependencies are updated.
